# Current Task

## Objective

Continue development and enhancement of the graph generation application with AI-powered suggestions.

## Accomplished

-   Initialized the project and set up the documentation structure
-   Reviewed and documented the existing project structure and key components
-   Updated the tech stack documentation with detailed dependency information
-   Created a comprehensive codebase summary
-   Reviewed and analyzed the `app/api/generate/route.ts` file to understand the graph generation API implementation
-   Examined the `app/page.tsx` file to understand how the components are integrated into the main application

## Current State

The project has a solid foundation with the following implemented:

-   Key components:
    -   SettingsForm for managing API settings
    -   MermaidGraph for rendering graphs
    -   TextInput for entering original text
    -   InstructionInput for entering instructions
    -   AISuggestions for displaying AI-generated suggestions
-   Main application page integrating all components
-   API route for graph generation using OpenAI
-   Real-time updates during graph generation
-   Basic error handling
-   Settings management with local storage persistence

The application uses Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, with Mermaid for graph visualization and OpenAI API for AI-powered features.

## Next Steps

1. Enhance error handling and implement more robust loading states for API calls
2. Improve the UI/UX of the application:
    - Add more interactive features
    - Implement responsive design for various screen sizes
    - Enhance accessibility
3. Implement unit tests for the key components
4. Set up end-to-end testing for the application
5. Optimize performance, especially for graph rendering with large datasets
6. Implement user authentication and authorization if required
7. Add more customization options for graph generation (e.g., graph type, color schemes)
8. Implement a feature to save and load generated graphs
9. Add a feature to export graphs in various formats (e.g., PNG, SVG)
10. Prepare deployment scripts and documentation for production release

## Notes

-   The integration between the frontend components and the API is working well, but could be further optimized
-   Consider implementing a state management solution (e.g., React Context or Redux) if the application complexity increases
-   Regularly update the documentation as new features are implemented or significant changes are made
-   Add a changelog to track major updates and versions
-   Consider implementing a caching mechanism for API responses to reduce unnecessary calls
-   Explore ways to make the instruction input more user-friendly, possibly with predefined templates or a guided input process
-   Investigate potential security improvements, especially around API key management
